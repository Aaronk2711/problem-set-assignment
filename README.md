Ok Mr. Wilson here we go. You must use the 2d Canvas API for the following problems.

## Excercise 1(Triangles)

Prompt the users for two different colors. Using these colors, make two triangles that are right next to each other so that they form a square. Both the triangles must have the same dimensions(your choice) and should not overlap with each other.

Support the following colors:

Purple
Green
Yellow
Black
Pink
Orange
Brown
Red
Blue

## Excerise 2(Clock)

Prompt the user for the radius of a clock. From there, create a clock with that radius and with a black outer edge and white background behind the hands. There should be short black lines for every hour and longer black lines to show the time. Also, add a black dot in the center where the hands meet. The clock should be set to 2:35. There is no need for a hand that measures seconds.
